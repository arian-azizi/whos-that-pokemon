## Introduction

_Pokemon_ - the little game that took the world by storm. The unassuming Game Boy title was released in 1996 and quickly spawned a multibillion dollar franchise that has become the world's largest by estimated revenue, encompassing multiple anime productions, a complete trading card game, and countless multimedia appearances.

"Who's That Pokemon?" was a popular segment in the original anime adaptation of _Pokemon_, allowing the young audience to guess the correct Pokemon whos silhouette was displayed on screen. **Who's That Pokemon?** is an homage to that pop culture memory - and a fun game in its own right!


## Rules

A round of **Who's That Pokemon?** will play out in the following format:

Players will attempt to guess the name of the randomly selected Pokemon and enter it into the text box provided (alongside an initial clue provided to help the player attempt to narrow down the Pokemon).

Players will continue to get additional clues for every incorrect guess until they either exhaust all the clues, after which they lose the game and Pokemon is revealed, or guess cirrectly, at which point point they win the game!
